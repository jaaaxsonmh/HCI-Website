                        After conducting the typing test on our participants I’ve gained a better understanding of some of positive and negative effects that different software and hardware can have on one’s performance in both occupation and livelihood. Upon seeing the improvements in typing speed and accuracy when one is given the opportunity to use a mechanical keyboard instead of a membrane keyboard it’s easy to see why so much time is spent investigating the way people interact with modern technology and how it can be made faster, easier and more accessible
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Our groups decision to investigate the effect keyboards can have on one’s productivity came easily as we all study computer and information science and all take an interest the usability of computer hardware and software. Deciding what we were aiming to achieve wasn’t as easily decided. Due to some restrictions in the aim of the experiment we could not compare a brand, product or price range. We had initially intended to consider the effects of a high end, expensive membrane keyboard against a low end, cheap one. After realising that this didn’t meet the aim we tried to simplify the investigation and instead look into the effect of using different keyboard layouts, such as azerty. After looking at other options we settled on investigating the speed and accuracy that one can type with when using both a membrane and mechanical keyboard and whether there were any noticeable differences in performance

                        During the assignment I carried out most of the testing. This was relatively simple and really just involved getting a range of people I knew that took the same major as I did to type the paragraphs from A Scandal in Bohemia and A Tale of Two Cities as quickly as they could on both the mechanical and membrane keyboard. Using Speed Typing Online I would then record both their time and accuracy after completing the paragraph. Given more time, I would have liked to have recorded the participants personal preference of the two keyboards as it was the first time four of the contestants had ever used a mechanical keyboard.

                        After completing the study I am definitely more aware of some of the problems products face when they are exposed to the user. For example, during the early stages of the assignment we were asked by our lab teaching assistant to use a range of products such as a heartbeat regulator to get an idea of what we might like to evaluate. While just about all of the products seemed to be well made and had a good premise, they all seemed either pointless and gimmicky or poorly designed for usability. For another paper I’m currently taking; Software Development Practise my group and I all agreed on developing an app for managing events and venues through a virtual interface. While I think we all believed that the idea was good and that we were quite capable of designing the app at the time, the app is now barely functioning has terrible usability and will likely require another semester of development if it is ever to function anything like the way we intended it to. Some of the products we evaluated are not unlike my app in Software Development Practise… they had good initial ideas, but spent very little time evaluating how people will interact with them. Judging these products on their failures in user friendliness and then a few weeks later seeing my own application fail to reach any kind of in depth usability has definitely made me aware of the fact that a good idea and well-made product are just about never enough to produce a successful outcome. Products that are designed with the user in mind, rather than their presentation or seemingly good premise are far more likely to be successful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Focussing on the user experience is obviously a huge aspect of the technology industry and one that is constantly brought up in advertisements and design documentation. Failures on a big scale are usually well publicized and usually attributed to something that seems very obvious in hindsight. After completing our evaluation I definitely feel like I can better understand how some of both the failures and successes can occur during the design of a product. Seeing the effect that a keyboard can have on one’s productiveness or the problems a product can face because of poor design

                        choices has definitely made me aware of the immense amount of planning that should go into usability. This is something I’m sure will be useful in my major, Software Development as I continue to get involved in larger scale software products where user-friendliness is an expectation, rather than a nicety.
