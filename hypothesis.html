            <h2 class="mt-4">Do mechanical keyboards pose an advantage of precision and speed over membrane
                keyboards?</h2>
            <p class="small-title">Subjects</p>
            <p> Fifteen under-graduate, and post-graduate students from Auckland University of Technology, within the
                School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical sciences that have volunteered to participate
                in our experiment. All of the fifteen students were familiar with a QWERTY keyboard layout, all students
                had the ability to touch type proficiently.
            <p class="small-title">Equipment</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Desk</p>
            <p>The lab room offers a standard plain office desk with a flat surface and a height suitable to have a
                comfortable setting position for typing. The keyboard will be placed in the same spot during each test
                on the desk, although subjects are allowed to move the keyboard forward, or backwards if they
                prefer. </p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Monitor</p>
            <p>The monitor has to have a full display in any aspect ratio. With a response time of less than 7 ms. </p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Setting Position </p>
            <p>This is where we want the subjects to be at their most comfortable, a range of standard office chairs
                with an upright setting position will be available to the subjects to choose from. We need the subject
                to
                as comfortable as possible so that the typing feels as natural and familiar to their office workspace or
                personally computer setups.</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Keyboard Mechanical</p>
            <p>A Razer Blackwidow keyboard was chosen to be our mechanical keyboard. The Blackwidow has a width of 18.7
                inches, depth of 6.7 inches, a height of 1.5 inches and weighs around 1.5 Kg
                The Razer Blackwidow is a popular choice among mechanical keyboards as it offers high button quality,
                macro keys for programming your own shortcuts and 10-key rollover, which means more key presses at one
                time will be recognized.
                It is also very responsive. This keyboard will be used as our mechanical base, due to its popularity and
                design it will reflect the typing speed and accuracy with other branded mechanical keyboards.</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Keyboard Membrane</p>
            <p>A Hewlett-Packard (HP) K1500 keyboard was chosen to be our membrane keyboard. HP is a respectable brand and
                Auckland University of Technology uses the HP K1500 in almost every single lab room in the WT building.
                The K1500 has a length of 17.3 inches, width of 6.4 inches and a height of 0.6 inches. The K1500 also weighs around 400 grams.
                Finding key-rollover and macro key details was difficult as it was not specified by the manufacturer. Although being such a large brand
                with an established reputation it was suitable as the membrane keyboard of choice for our experiment.
            </p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Speed Typer Online</p>
            <p>As a group, we used certain online speed typers, we found <a href="http://www.speedtypingonline.com">Speed
                Typing Online </a> to be helpful in gathering data and displaying the different texts. Speed Typing is
                responsive and displays Speed (Words Per Minute) and accuracy in a percentage, with a test time of one
                minute.
                We will use Speed Typing Online as a consistent speed and accuracy gather. </p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Different Texts</p>
            <p>For Mechanical Keyboards we are going to use the first paragraph from "A Scandal in Bohemia", from The
                Adventures of Sherlock Holmes written by Arthur Conan Doyle. The paragraph is 208 words and to complete
                the whole paragraph
                would take 208 words per minute which is well above the typing speed of an advanced typists who works at
                a speed of above 120 words per minute.</p>
            <p class="text-quote">"To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under
                any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
                any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his
                cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing
                machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He
                never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the
                observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained teasoner
                to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a
                distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
                instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong
                emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late
                Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory."</p>
            <p>For Membrane Keyboards we are going to use the first chapter from "A tale of two cities" which is a
                historical novel written by Charles Dickens. The paragraph is 119 words long and will be well out of
                reach for our subjects to complete the paragraph within one minute. </p>
            <p class="text-quote">"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
                the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season
                of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
                everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
                direct the other way â€“ in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its
                noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
                comparison only."</p>
            <p class="small-title-i"> Research Hypothesis: </p>
            <p>Using a mechanical keyboard will result in an increased typing speed and typing precision in AUT
                students</p>
            <p class="small-title-i"> Null Hypothesis: </p>
            <p>Using a mechanical keyboard will result in a decrease or no change of typing speed and typing precision
                in AUT students</p>
            <p class="small-title">Measurement gathering</p>
            <p> The mechanical or membrane keyboard will cause a change in the speed and accuracy of a user and it is
                not possible that the speed and accuracy of a user could cause a change in keyboard type.</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Speed</p>
            <p>Speed will be measured in the amount of correct words typed within one minute.</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Time</p>
            <p>Time will be controlled to one minute starting from the first key press, whether incorrect press or
                correct press.</p>
            <p class="smaller-title">Accuracy</p>
            <p>Accuracy will be recorded automatically as a percentage out of 100, accuracy will increase or decrease
                dependant on the key that is pressed and the key that being asked for from the text.</p>
