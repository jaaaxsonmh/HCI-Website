                <h2 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h2>
                <p style="padding-top: 10px">
                    To conclude, we can see from our analysis that as typing speed increased, accuracy also increased
                    for a mechanical keyboard a membrane keyboard showed that as speed increases, accuracy decreases
                    54% of the participants were able to have a higher typing speed on the mechanical keyboard and 21%
                    of participants were more accurate on a mechanical keyboard. We predict that this finding is the
                    result of a very small margin for improvement of accuracy, as all apart from one participant has
                    very high accuracy.
                    The typing speeds had more room for improvement is why we can see more difference in the data and a
                    higher percentage of improved typing speeds.
                    The trend line shows that as participants type faster on a membrane keyboard their accuracy
                    decreases, we relate this finding to the roll over period of the keyboards, which mechanical
                    keyboards have a much higher roll over period of key presses meaning more keys can be recognised in
                    quick succession. To finalise our conclusion, we found that with more time, the participants that
                    are
                    not familiar with a mechanical keyboard will be able to increase their typing speed with more
                    practice
                    as with practice comes perfection.
                    After the analysis of our trend line and regression data we can safely conclude that mechanical
                    keyboards do
                    in fact have an advantage over membrane keyboards in relation to typing speed and accuracy and
                    recommend mechanical
                    keyboards to aspiring Computer Science students so they can take advantage of what this mechanical
                    technology can
                    provide them over a membrane keyboard.

                <h2 class="mt-4">Improvements</h2>
                <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
                    We did not take into consideration the Hawthrone Effect. The Hawthrone effect states that under
                    observation, people may undertake tasks or act differently than how they would if they knew they
                    were not being monitored. We had to monitor the participants to make sure that they were typing at
                    their best ability. Because of this, some of their accuracy may have declined due to the pressure
                    they may have felt with people watching them. We can see that the Hawthrone Effect may have affected
                    a few participants, with a larger sample size it would need to be closely monitored and identified for
                    the effect to not affect the results.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 2px;">
                    Another area to improve on would be the sampling method. With convenience sample we feel that the people
                    who were willing to participate were very, very confident in their typing ability and giving us a data set
                    with really high accuracy and really high words per minute. Changing the sampling method to a random sample
                    from a lab room, or in one of the student lounges and using a movable device like a laptop would have given
                    a more accurate representation of the whole population of Computer Science students.
