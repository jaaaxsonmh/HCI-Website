                    Does using a mechanical keyboard will result in an increased typing speed and typing precision in
                    AUT students? All results from our testing speared to be close and somewhat similar. However, a
                    close examination of the data suggests that a conclusion that mechanical keyboards do increase
                    typing speed and typing precision can be made.<br><br>
                    Typing speed measured in words per minute, the mechanical keyboard on average was recorded to have a
                    higher typing speed. 54% of participants typed faster on a Mechanical keyboard 13% showed no change
                    and 33% were slower. Participant one was on average seven words per minute faster, participant seven
                    was eight words faster and participant fourteen at the highest increase of eleven words. Of the
                    participants there were slower 75% were only slower by one-two words per minute. With average word
                    per minute speeds of between sixty to seventy words, a one word per minute decrease in speed is
                    minute when compared to the increase of up to eleven words per minute seen by other participants.<br><br>
                    When measuring accuracy, we found the AUT students were more actuate on the membrane keyboard
                    overall with 50% of participants to be slower, 29% showed no change and only 21% were more accurate.
                    50% of participants were more accurate or showed no decrease in accuracy while 54% showed an
                    increase in typing speed. Of the less accurate precipitants on the mechanical keyboard 71% were less
                    accurate by one-two percent. Participant fourteen saw a 16% increase in typing speed for 1% decrease
                    in accuracy.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p style="padding-top: 10px">
                    To conclude, we can see from our analysis that as typing speed increased, accuracy also increased for a mechanical keyboard a membrane keyboard showed that as speed increases, accuracy decreases
                    54% of the participants were able to have a higher typing speed on the mechanical keyboard and 21% of participants were more accurate on a mechanical keyboard. We predict that this finding is the result of a very small margin for improvement of accuracy, as all apart from one participant has very high accuracy.
                    The trend line shows that as participants type faster on a membrane keyboard their accuracy decreases, we relate this finding to the roll over period of the keyboards, which mechanical keyboards have a much higher roll over period of key presses.
                    The typing speeds had more room for improvement is why we can see more difference in the data and a higher percentage of improved typing speeds. Analysising our trend line and regression data we can safely conclude that mechanical keyboards do in fact have an advantage over membrane keyboards. This advantage clearly shows
                    that mechanical keyboards are better

                    // over time mechanical better
                    // key roll over period
