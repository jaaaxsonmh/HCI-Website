                    <p class="card-text">What I have learnt from this assignment is that I have increased my
                        interest in Human-Computer Interaction. Especially around how devices are physically interacted
                        with as it has begun to shown me how technology has advanced and how these research and
                        experiments we are completing can show relationships that could be the start of a newly
                        developed technology.
                        I am happy about the research topic my group and I decided on; as every day Computer Science
                        students will be interacting with a keyboard and our research topic will help students decide
                        on which type of keyboard type between Mechanical and Membrane would be suit their needs.
                        I would have liked to allow more time for researching into the preparation of the experiment,
                        as I feel we could have examined more types of keyboards and built onto the research with different
                        types of mechanical switches and if they pose advantages as well.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I have learnt a lot about presenting an experiment and about statistics. I also realised how much I do not know around
                        statistical analysis so I have a lot to learn before conducting another statistical analysis which I will benefit from
                        in the future. I understand the results we gathered and solely created the Regression Statistics analysis and shaped
                        the analysis of those statistics from some own-learning of lynda.com videos about regression statistics. I feel my understanding
                        of what values in the regression statistics table mean, has greatly increased and I can confidently explain the significance of data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        My experience in Applied HCI has begun to change my understanding of HCI. I have learnt a lot about developing technologies and ways we can
                        investigate these technologies and test if they do provide the benefits that they claim to. I will be able to apply this in the future
                        projects I work on whether external or internal to Auckland University of Technology. I will bring my experience from HCI into Research and Development
                        next semester to help with developing our application Runfinity for a public beta release.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I can bring my experience with HCI into Research and Development to help with our public release. I will be able to have a conversation with my group
                        and project sponsors about possible usability problems and how to overcome these problems by introducing the topics taught in HCI by Robert.
                        Like Haptics and heuristics.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Overall I enjoyed my roll in this project and took advantage of my time to really build onto my learning as a Software Development Student. Not only with
                        Human Computer Interaction but with website development. The project was enjoyable.
