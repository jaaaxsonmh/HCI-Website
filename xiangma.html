                    <p class="card-text">In the experiment, one of the difficulties is the standards of participants we
                        choose. Because we want people who have already got some experience in typing. We don't want
                        some people who have totally no experience in typing or people who are typing masters. That
                        would produce extreme data and make the whole data we collected less reliable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        To make the data from AUT students who have learnt computer science paper or doing programming
                        relater major. Another difficulty is that it is hard to determine if handedness has any effect
                        in the experiment. Certainly lots of people are right-handed and people use both hands for
                        typing. But it is still controversial to say handedness has no influence in typing. Thus we can
                        only ask participants who are right-handed so that the result is fair enough to participants.
                        What I learnt from our experiment is that mechanical keyboard can be effectively used by
                        experienced users. The typing speed and accuracy can both be increased. Thus as one of the
                        analyzers in the group, also as a student majored computer science, I would not choose to buy a
                        mechanical keyboard now. Because I can’t type very fast and the programming work I’m doing
                        currently doesn’t require high-speed typing. Whereas, if I get a job which requires people to
                        type in high speed. I would consider buying a mechanical keyboard in order to increase my typing
                        speed and accuracy.
