                <p style="padding-top: 10px">
                    To make a claim on to what the results actually mean, we will have to create an analysis for any
                    trends we see to verify that they have enough statistical significance for a claim to based upon.
                    For
                    creating the analysis, since all our data was recorded in Microsoft Excel we performed a regression
                    statistic for the word
                    per minute and accuracy data recorded. Microsoft Excel regression statistics table shows a wide
                    range of statistical values and properties and a lot of these do not concern us with the analysis of
                    our project. The regression statistics
                    give us a 'best fit' graph for each of the data sets dependant on keyboard type.

                <p style="padding-top: 20px">
                    The Regression Statistics for Mechanical keyboard data, we can see the R Squared value is at 58.82%
                    (0.5882) for a fitted line which is accounting for 58.82% of the variance or around half of the
                    variance along the best fit line.
                    We can take note of the Adjusted R Squared value. Which is quite indifferent with an Adjusted
                    R Squared value of 55.65% (0.5565) a 3.17% difference between the both.
                    This will show that the line of best fit will visibly close to
                    the raw data plots. The signification of the regression can be found in the ANOVA section of the
                    Regression Statistics Table.
                    The signification is labeled by the Significance F column and is known as the P-value. The
                    P-Value is very small at 0.00085 because this value is lower
                    than 0.05, it is correct to say it has strong evidence against the null hypothesis,
                    and supports the hypothesis strongly.

                <img class="img-fluid" src="css/images/regression-membrane.png">
                <p style="padding-top: 20px">
                    The Regression Statistics for Membrane keyboard data shows that the R-Squared value is 24.08%
                    (0.2408) which sits fairly low, meaning the model generated only accounts for 24% of the variance
                    along the best fit line,
                    or nearly one quarter. We can attribute this to the inclusion of outliers found in the membrane
                    keyboard data, which could skew the results.
                    The P-Value which is found in the ANOVA section is 0.063. This P-Value is quite high at over 0.05
                    which in our case supports the hypothesis of Mechanical keyboards being more accurate and faster to
                    type with. Since a P-Value of 0.063 will support the null-hypothesis for Membrane keyboards having a
                    correlation between typing speed and accuracy.

                    <li>Participants 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14 and 15 were all on average faster when typing on the mechanical
                        keyboard. Their speeds ranging from 1 to 10 words per minute faster.</li>
                    <li>Participants 6 and 13 showed no increase or decrease in typing speed on a mechanical keyboard.</li>
                    <li>Finally Participants 10, 11 and 12 were 1 to 2 words per minute slower with participant 3 being 27 words slower on a mechanical keyboard.</li>
                    <li> 8 participants were faster on a mechanical keyboard, 2 participants showed no difference and 5 participants were slower on a mechanical keyboard.</li>

                        <li>Participants 2, 7 and 8 showed to have an increase in typing accuracy on a mechanical keyboard</li>
                        <li>Participants 9, 10, 11 and 12 showed no change of accuracy on a mechanical keyboard</li>
                        <li>Finally participants 1, 4, 5, 6, 13 and 15 were all 1% less accurate on a mechanical keyboard and participant 3 was 33% less accurate on a mechanical keyboard. </li>
                        <li>Three participants were more accurate on a mechanical, four participants showed no difference and six participants had an accuracy 1% lower and one participant was 33% less accurate.</li>

                <p style="padding-top: 20px">
                    The trend line on the Mechanical Keyboard Only graph clearly shows that there is a proportional
                    relationship between typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy of typing. As typing speed
                    increases so does accuracy. This is in contrast to the Membrane Only graph, which shows
                    a negative trend. As words per minute increases, accuracy decreases. There is an outlier which is
                    significantly different from the rest of the results. We believe that this is still an accurate
                    representation of the population, with a larger sample size we expect there to be more results
                    around the outlier and in between.
