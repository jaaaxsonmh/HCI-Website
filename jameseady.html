                    <p class="card-text">I always knew human computer interaction was key in all aspect of technology,
                        however I never understood to what degree. Only after this project did I gain an understanding.
                        They way technology is design we can too easily take for granted. Something mundane that we do
                        every day for both university work and personal reasons such as typing on keyboard has so many
                        small variables and components. Things like typing speed and typing accuracy at first don’t
                        really seem all that important, however there is famous saying that time is money and the more
                        time you spend typing the more money it costs you. Productivity in many areas of life relays so
                        heavily on one’s ability to type precisely and quickly. Our groups topic of does a mechanical
                        keyboard allow fasting typing and better accuracy is something that I have wanted to answer for
                        a long time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        All my group got on very well and we seemed to agree on almost everything making working with
                        them pleasurable. I have had no experience with statistical reports. I found that in early
                        drafts of the conclusion I was analysing data too much and not actually make any conclusion.
                        Good thing I have a competent group that helped me and added to the conclusion. I feel like I
                        learnt more working with this group then I would have with any other. I would have liked to
                        enter more detail about each keyboard, considering things such as key travel distance and more
                        types of keyboards and their respective switches.

                        This new view point about HCI will be very useful in my chosen major of Software Development. It
                        is very easy to create some software for a logic and coding point of view and asking users to
                        work around my work. This should not be the case and I am now more aware of that. Simple put my
                        design process has changed to always think of the user first. HCI has also opened my eyes to
                        possible bad habits that could cause me issues down the road such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

                        This project has left me feeling mixed, there are areas that I feel confident in such as
                        analysing results and some areas of the website building. However, I would also like to learn a
                        lot more an expand my knowledge in both areas. Overall, I believe the project was a success and
                        I can stay I can see that I have learned.
